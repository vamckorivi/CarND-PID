# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program - PID Control Project

# Objective
Objective of this project to Use PID Controllers to drive the car around the track in the simulator environment. CTE(Cross Track Error) is read from the simulator using websocket and is used to calculate the steering angle for the next step.

Here is the demo of the project after fine tuning the parameters- Kp(tau_p), Kd(tau_d), Ki(tau_i).

# Parameters and Fine Tuning
PID - Proportional, Integral, Derivative Controller is used in this project to predict the steering angle of the car and to keep it on the track.
P- Proportional - Proportional control is to keep the steering angle in proportion to Cross Track Error. But this P Controller alone causes overshoots and causes oscillating driving experience.
D - Derivate - Derivate Control is used to reduce the oscillations drive of the car using the time derivative of the cross track error. If there is a system bias(steerig drift example), PD controller fails.
I - Integral - Integral control uses the sum of the cross track error. 

Final Parameters for PID for Steering are- P:0.0135, I-0.0025, D-3.05

I have tried using twiddle algorithm by setting the intial values as 0,0,0 and throtlle is kept constant for this project. With twiddle, for some reason the car was not able to make much progress. So, I have to manually adjust the parameters starting with Udacity values, playing with the P value and keeping the I and D constant and then D value and very small changes for I value was enough to get the car complete the track.

For now, manual tuning of the parameters did work and let the car run on the track. As I have the whole track to test, manual tuning worked out but in real time scneario the tuning should be done on the fly and I will be implementing twiddle/SGD to automatically tune the parameters and see how it works. Also, I need to work on tuning throttle using PID.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
